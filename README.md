## BODY MASS PREDICTON FROM FACE IMAGES

Overview
This project aims to estimate body mass index (BMI) from face images using computer vision and machine learning techniques. BMI is a commonly used indicator of body fatness and is calculated using a person's height and weight. By analyzing facial features and correlating them with BMI values, this system provides a non-invasive method for estimating BMI from face images.

Features

Face Detection: Utilizes computer vision algorithms to detect and localize faces within input images.

Facial Landmark Detection: Identifies key facial landmarks to properly align faces and extract relevant features.

Feature Extraction: Extracts facial features correlated with BMI, such as facial width-to-height ratio and jawline definition.

Machine Learning Model: Trains a regression model to predict BMI from facial features extracted from input images.

Accuracy Evaluation: Evaluates the model's performance using metrics such as mean absolute error (MAE) and Pearson correlation coefficient.
