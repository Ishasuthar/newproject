## BODY MASS PREDICTON FROM FACE IMAGES

Overview
This project aims to estimate body mass index (BMI) from face images using computer vision and machine learning techniques. BMI is a commonly used indicator of body fatness and is calculated using a person's height and weight. By analyzing facial features and correlating them with BMI values, this system provides a non-invasive method for estimating BMI from face images.
